"2. Data are not available for this area for all of the requested years. See Caveats below for more information."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. 'Missing' appears when county data is not available for a certain year. This occurs because geography changes over time. New"
"counties are created and old counties are deleted or their boundaries are modified.."
"2. County geography changes over time. New counties are created and old counties are deleted or their boundaries are modified."
"The county codes and names for years 1990-1999 are based on Census 2000 geography; those for year 2000 and later are based on"
"Census 2010 geography."
"3. Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska (FIPS code 02105) was created from the former Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (FIPS code"
"02232) effective June 20, 2007. This change was made retroactive in the data to the year 2000. Therefore population estimates"
"for Hoonah-Angoon Census Area are available for years 2000 and later."
"4. Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska (FIPS code 02130) annexed most of Outer Ketchikan from the former Prince of Wales-Outer"
"Ketchikan Census Area (FIPS code 02201) effective May 19, 2008. This change was made retroactive in the data to the year 2000."
"Therefore Ketchikan Gateway Borough has a discontinuity in the population estimates between 1999 and 2000 due to the addition of"
"population."
"5. About Petersburg Borough/Census Area, Alaska (FIPS code 02195): Petersburg Census Area was formed on June 1, 2008 from part"
